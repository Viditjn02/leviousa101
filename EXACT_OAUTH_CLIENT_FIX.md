# 🔧 EXACT OAUTH CLIENT FIX
## Based on Your Current Configuration

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUE:**
Your OAuth client has **mixed old/new domains and too many localhost URIs** causing Google to flag it as "legacy browsers" and "granular permissions" issues.

## 📋 **EXACT ACTIONS TO TAKE:**

### **STEP 1: Clean Up Redirect URIs**

**REMOVE these problematic URIs:**
```
❌ https://leviousa-101.web.app/oauth/callback (old Firebase domain)
❌ http://localhost:3001/callback (unnecessary)
❌ http://localhost:3002/callback (unnecessary)  
❌ http://localhost:3003/callback (unnecessary)
❌ http://localhost:3004/callback (unnecessary)
❌ http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback (unnecessary)
❌ http://127.0.0.1:54321/paragon/callback (can cause conflicts)
```

**KEEP only these essential URIs:**
```
✅ https://www.leviousa.com/oauth/callback (primary production)
✅ http://localhost:3000/callback (development)
✅ https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth (Paragon service)
```

### **STEP 2: Update URIs to Modern Pattern**

**On your current OAuth client page:**

1. **Delete old Firebase URI:**
   - Find `https://leviousa-101.web.app/oauth/callback`
   - Click the delete icon (🗑️) next to it

2. **Delete unnecessary localhost URIs:**
   - Remove all localhost URIs except `localhost:3000/callback`
   - Remove the 127.0.0.1 URI

3. **Keep these 3 URIs only:**
   ```
   https://www.leviousa.com/oauth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/callback
   https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth
   ```

4. **Click "Save"**

## 🎯 **WHY THIS FIXES THE WARNINGS:**

### **Granular Permissions Fix:**
- **Mixed domains confuse Google** about which consent flow to use
- **Old Firebase domain** may not support granular permissions
- **Clean URI list** lets Google properly detect modern capabilities

### **Legacy Browsers Fix:**
- **Too many localhost URIs** look like legacy integration patterns
- **Mixed HTTP/HTTPS** triggers security warnings
- **Clean, minimal URI list** shows modern authentication approach

## ✅ **EXPECTED RESULT:**

After saving the cleaned up redirect URIs:
- ✅ "Granular permissions" warning disappears
- ✅ "Legacy browsers" warning disappears
- ✅ OAuth consent screen becomes accessible
- ✅ Can configure scopes and submit for verification

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

**Right now on your OAuth client page:**
1. **Delete the old Firebase URI** (leviousa-101.web.app)
2. **Delete extra localhost URIs** (keep only localhost:3000)
3. **Save changes**
4. **Refresh the Project checkup page**
5. **Warnings should be gone!**

The issue is **URI configuration conflicts**, not missing features! 🎯
