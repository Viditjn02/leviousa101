# ActionKit 402 Error Fix

## Issue Analysis

The logs show repeated 402 errors from ActionKit API:

```
ActionKit API error: 402 - {"message":"ActionKit is not enabled on your account. Contact sales@useparagon.com to add ActionKit to your account.","code":"10202","status":402,"meta":{"featureName":"actionkit","plan":"connect_trial","projectId":"f7e139ca-5ef0-4211-9118-2d65154fc2a6","subscriptionId":"d7ccfc3e-def2-45c1-aa31-1639fef3e3c7"}}
```

## Root Cause

- **Plan**: `connect_trial` - Trial plan doesn't include ActionKit
- **Feature**: `actionkit` - Premium feature requiring paid subscription
- **Status**: 402 Payment Required - Need to upgrade account

## Fix Strategy

1. **Immediate**: Graceful fallback when ActionKit unavailable
2. **Long-term**: Implement direct MCP tool usage without ActionKit dependency
3. **Alternative**: Use Paragon's basic MCP tools directly
