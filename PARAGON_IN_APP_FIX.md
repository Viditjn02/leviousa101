# Paragon In-App Connect Portal Fix

## Issue Summary
The Paragon Connect Portal is opening in a browser window instead of displaying in-app as an overlay, and still getting error code 7105 (redirect URL missing).

## Root Causes

### 1. Environment Variables Missing
The Next.js app needs proper environment configuration:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PARAGON_PROJECT_ID` (client-side)
- `PARAGON_SIGNING_KEY` (server-side)

### 2. Redirect URLs Not Configured
The Paragon dashboard must have these redirect URLs configured:
- `https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth` (required)
- Your application URLs (localhost and production)

### 3. Connect Portal Configuration
The portal should display as an in-app overlay, not open in browser.

## Implemented Fixes

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Environment Configuration
Created `leviousa_web/.env.local` with proper variables:

```bash
# Paragon Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARAGON_PROJECT_ID=db5e019e-0558-4378-93de-f212a73e0606
PARAGON_SIGNING_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----..."
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Enhanced JWT Token Generation
Updated `leviousa_web/pages/api/paragonToken.ts`:
- Added proper error handling
- Dynamic user ID generation
- Improved logging
- Proper JWT structure with `aud` field

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Improved Connect Component
Enhanced `leviousa_web/components/ParagonConnect.tsx`:
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Loading states
- Proper `paragon.connect()` configuration with callbacks
- Multiple integration options (Gmail, Slack, Notion)
- Styled buttons and clear UI

## Required Manual Steps

### üîß Configure Redirect URLs in Paragon Dashboard

**CRITICAL**: You must manually configure these URLs in your Paragon dashboard:

1. **Login to Paragon Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.useparagon.com
   - Sign in to your account
   - Navigate to your project (ID: `db5e019e-0558-4378-93de-f212a73e0606`)

2. **Add Redirect URLs:**
   - Go to **Settings > SDK Setup** or **OAuth Settings**
   - Add these redirect URLs:
     ```
     https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth
     http://localhost:3000
     http://localhost:3001
     https://leviousa-101.web.app
     https://your-production-domain.com
     ```

3. **Enable Integrations:**
   - Make sure Gmail, Slack, and Notion integrations are **Active**
   - Check that each integration has proper OAuth credentials configured

### üöÄ Testing Steps

1. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   cd leviousa_web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add ParagonConnect Component:**
   Add to any page where you want the Connect Portal:
   ```jsx
   import ParagonConnect from '../components/ParagonConnect'
   
   export default function MyPage() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>My App</h1>
         <ParagonConnect 
           onSuccess={(integration) => {
             console.log(`Connected to ${integration}!`)
           }}
           onError={(error) => {
             console.error('Connection failed:', error)
           }}
         />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

3. **Test the Integration:**
   - Click "Connect Gmail" button
   - Should see Connect Portal as overlay (NOT browser window)
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Should NOT get 7105 error

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ‚úÖ Correct Behavior:
1. **In-App Display**: Connect Portal appears as overlay within the application
2. **No 7105 Error**: Redirect URLs are properly configured
3. **Smooth OAuth Flow**: Users can complete authentication without issues
4. **Success Callbacks**: App receives success/error callbacks properly

### ‚ùå Issues Fixed:
- ‚ùå Portal opening in separate browser window
- ‚ùå Error 7105 (redirect URL missing)
- ‚ùå Authentication failures
- ‚ùå Poor error handling

## Verification Checklist

After implementing these fixes and configuring redirect URLs:

- [ ] Environment variables configured in `.env.local`
- [ ] Redirect URLs added to Paragon dashboard
- [ ] Integrations marked as "Active" in dashboard
- [ ] ParagonConnect component added to app
- [ ] Connect Portal opens as in-app overlay
- [ ] No 7105 errors in console
- [ ] OAuth flow completes successfully
- [ ] Success/error callbacks work properly

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still getting 7105 error
**Solution**: Double-check redirect URLs in Paragon dashboard are exactly:
- `https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth`
- Your application domain URLs

### Issue: Portal still opens in browser
**Solution**: 
- Ensure Paragon SDK is loaded properly
- Check that `paragon.connect()` is called with proper options
- Verify no popup blockers are interfering

### Issue: "Paragon not configured" error
**Solution**:
- Check `.env.local` file exists in `leviousa_web/` directory
- Verify environment variable names match exactly
- Restart development server after adding env vars

### Issue: Authentication fails
**Solution**:
- Verify Project ID matches dashboard
- Check signing key is properly formatted
- Ensure JWT token structure is correct

## Integration URLs for Reference

When configuring redirect URLs in Paragon dashboard, use these based on your setup:

### Development:
- `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js dev server)
- `http://localhost:3001` (if using custom port)

### Production:
- `https://leviousa-101.web.app` (if using Firebase hosting)
- `https://your-custom-domain.com` (your production domain)

### Required:
- `https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth` (Paragon's standard redirect)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure redirect URLs** in Paragon dashboard (manual step)
2. **Test the integration** thoroughly
3. **Add to main application** where needed
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues**
5. **Deploy to production** when working
