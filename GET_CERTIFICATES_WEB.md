3. **User Email**: Your Apple ID email

5. **CA Email**: Leave blank
6. **Request is**: "Saved to disk"
7. Click **Continue** ‚Üí Save the .certSigningRequest file

## Step 3: Install Certificates (1 minute)

1. **Double-click** the downloaded .cer files
2. They'll automatically install in **Keychain Access**
3. **Verify installation**:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

You should see:

## üöÄ Alternative: Super Quick Method

If you want to skip the CSR creation, here's the fastest way:

### Use the command line to create CSR:
```bash
# Create private key and CSR in one command
openssl req -new -keyout leviousa_private_key.pem -out leviousa.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj "/CN=Leviousa Developer/O=Your Company/C=US"
```

Then upload `leviousa.csr` to the Apple Developer portal for both certificates.

**This method works without Xcode and uses minimal disk space! üéâ**
