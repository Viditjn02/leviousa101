# 🔧 Multiple Google Accounts Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: Google Sign-In picks up the **wrong Google account** when multiple accounts are signed in to the browser.

**Example**: User expects to sign in with `viditjn02@gmail.com` but system authenticates with `viditjn03@gmail.com` instead.

**Root Cause**: Firebase Google authentication was using the browser's "default" Google account without forcing account selection.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Force Account Selection Dialog**
Added `prompt: 'select_account'` to the Google OAuth provider configuration:

```typescript
// BEFORE (picks default account)
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider()

// AFTER (forces account selection)  
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider()
provider.setCustomParameters({
  'prompt': 'select_account',  // Forces account selection dialog
  'hd': ''  // Allow any domain (not just G Suite)
})
```

### 2. **Clear Previous Auth State**
Added Firebase auth state clearing before each sign-in attempt:

```typescript
// Clear any existing Firebase auth state to prevent wrong account issues
logger.debug('🔄 Clearing existing Firebase auth state before Google Sign-In')
await auth.signOut()
logger.debug('✅ Previous auth state cleared')
```

## 🧪 **How It Works Now**

### ✅ **New Authentication Flow**:
1. **User clicks "Sign in with Google"**
2. **System clears any cached auth state** (prevents wrong account)
3. **Google OAuth opens with account selection dialog**
4. **User sees all their Google accounts** and can choose the correct one
5. **System authenticates with the selected account** (not the default)
6. **App shows correct user info** matching the selected account

### 🔍 **What the User Will See**:
Instead of automatically using the first Google account, users will now see:

```
Choose an account to continue to Leviousa

👤 viditjn02@gmail.com
👤 viditjn03@gmail.com  
👤 other@gmail.com

[Add another account] [Use another account]
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **🎯 Accurate Authentication**: Always get the intended Google account
2. **👥 Multiple Account Support**: Works correctly when users have 2+ Google accounts
3. **🔒 No Wrong Account Issues**: Eliminates authentication with unintended accounts  
4. **🧹 Clean State**: Clears cached auth to prevent cross-account contamination
5. **📱 Universal Fix**: Works for both browser popup and redirect flows

## 💡 **Technical Details**

### Google OAuth Custom Parameters:
- **`prompt: 'select_account'`**: Forces Google to show account selection even if user is already signed in
- **`hd: ''`**: Allows any email domain (not restricted to G Suite domains)

### Firebase Auth State Management:
- **`auth.signOut()`**: Clears any cached Firebase authentication before new sign-in
- **Prevents account cross-contamination** between sign-in attempts

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Test with Multiple Google Accounts:
1. **Sign into multiple Google accounts** in your browser (gmail.com)
2. **Go to Leviousa app** and click "Sign in with Google"  
3. **Verify**: You should see **account selection dialog** instead of auto-login
4. **Choose the correct account** you want to use
5. **Verify**: App should authenticate with the **selected account**

### Expected Console Logs:
```
🔄 Clearing existing Firebase auth state before Google Sign-In
✅ Previous auth state cleared
🔔 Auth state changed: User your-chosen-email@gmail.com
✅ Firebase authentication successful: [correct-uid]
```
