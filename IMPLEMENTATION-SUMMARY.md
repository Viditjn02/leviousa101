# Leviousa Implementation Summary

## Overview
Leviousa101 has been successfully created by combining the working Glass application with the advanced features that Leviousa was trying to implement.

## Base Architecture
- **Foundation**: Glass-main (working application)
- **Enhancements**: Features from Leviousa project
- **Approach**: Keep Glass's stable architecture while adding Leviousa's innovations

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Pre-configured API Keys ✅
- **File**: `/src/bridge/leviousaBridge.js`
- **Config**: `/src/features/common/config/leviousa-config.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Bypassed API key header screen
  - Pre-configured OpenAI, Anthropic, and Deepgram keys
  - Automatic provider configuration on startup
  - Always returns `true` for `areProvidersConfigured()`

### 2. Speaker Intelligence System ✅
- **Files**: 
  - `/src/features/intelligence/speakerIntelligence.js`
  - `/src/features/intelligence/sttServiceEnhancer.js`
  - `/src/features/intelligence/enhancedSttService.js`
- **Features**:
  - Distinguishes between user and participant speech
  - Content-based speaker detection
  - Context-aware analysis
  - User voice calibration
  - Only shows insights from OTHER speakers

### 3. Integration Points ✅
- **Main Process**: Modified `src/index.js` to initialize Leviousa bridge
- **Listen Service**: Enhanced to use speaker intelligence when enabled
- **IPC Handlers**: Added Leviousa-specific handlers for configuration

### 4. Sieve Eye Contact Correction ✅
- **Files**:
  - `/src/features/eyecontact/sieveEyeContactService.js`
  - `/src/features/eyecontact/eyeContactBridge.js`
  - `/src/ui/settings/EyeContactSettings.js`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time eye contact correction in video calls
  - Uses Sieve AI API for processing
  - Configurable through settings UI
  - API key management
  - Frame throttling for performance

### 5. Configuration System ✅
- **Environment Variables**: Added in `.env`
- **Feature Flags**:
  - `ENABLE_SPEAKER_INTELLIGENCE=true`
  - `ENABLE_MEETING_INTELLIGENCE=true`
  - `ENABLE_MEMORY_SYSTEM=true`
  - `ENABLE_LOCAL_LLM=true`

## Technical Implementation

### Initialization Flow
1. App starts → Database initialization
2. Model State Service initialization
3. **Leviousa Bridge** initializes pre-configured API keys
4. Feature bridges initialize
5. Speaker Intelligence activates if enabled
6. App skips API key screen and goes directly to main interface

### Speaker Intelligence Flow
1. Audio captured → STT Service
2. Enhanced STT Service intercepts transcriptions
3. Speaker Intelligence analyzes:
   - First-person vs second-person language
   - Speech continuity
   - Context from recent transcriptions
4. Identifies speaker as User or Participant
5. Only generates insights for Participant speech
6. Sends insights to overlay for display

## What Makes This Different

### From Original Glass:
- No user API key input required
- Pre-configured with working API keys
- Enhanced with speaker intelligence
- Better meeting insights

### From Original Leviousa:
- Uses Glass's stable architecture as base
- Fixed implementation issues
- Proper integration of features
- Working application

```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd leviousa_web && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Build Web Interface**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:web
   ```

3. **Start Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Verify Features**:
   - App should start without showing API key screen
   - Check console for "Pre-configured API keys initialized"
   - Start a meeting to test speaker intelligence
   - Speak to calibrate your voice
   - Insights should only appear for other speakers

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. Add native audio recording (from Leviousa's plan)
2. Implement meeting summaries
3. Add memory system for persistent knowledge
4. Enhance privacy controls
5. Add more AI providers

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- Glass-main used as stable base
- Pre-configured API keys working
- No API key screen for users
- Speaker Intelligence integrated
- Application starts and runs properly
- Features from Leviousa successfully added
