# Paragon Authentication Complete Fix

## Issue Summary
The user reported that while Paragon authentication appeared to work in the browser (Connect Portal), the main app was unable to detect authenticated services. The `get_authenticated_services` API was consistently returning an empty array despite successful authentication.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. JWT Algorithm Mismatch
**Problem**: The Paragon MCP server was using the default HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) algorithm for JWT signing, but it was provided with an RSA private key which requires RSA-SHA256 (RS256) algorithm.

**Error**: `secretOrPrivateKey must be a symmetric key when using HS256`

**Fix**: Modified `services/paragon-mcp/src/index.ts` to use RS256 algorithm:
```typescript
return jwt.sign(payload, formattedPrivateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' });
```

### 2. Environment Variable Mapping Mismatch
**Problem**: The main application's ServerRegistry was loading the Paragon `.env` file but mapping the wrong variable names.

**Mismatch**:
- `.env` file contained: `PARAGON_PROJECT_ID`, `PARAGON_JWT_SECRET`
- ServerRegistry was looking for: `PROJECT_ID`, `SIGNING_KEY`

**Fix**: Updated `src/features/invisibility/mcp/ServerRegistry.js` to properly map variables:
```javascript
// Map from the actual .env variable names to what the server expects
env['PARAGON_PROJECT_ID'] = process.env.PARAGON_PROJECT_ID || paragonEnv.parsed?.PARAGON_PROJECT_ID;
env['PARAGON_JWT_SECRET'] = process.env.PARAGON_JWT_SECRET || paragonEnv.parsed?.PARAGON_JWT_SECRET;
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `services/paragon-mcp/src/index.ts`
- Added RS256 algorithm specification for JWT signing
- Enhanced debugging logs for JWT key format validation
- Improved private key newline handling

### 2. `src/features/invisibility/mcp/ServerRegistry.js`
- Fixed environment variable mapping for Paragon credentials
- Corrected logging to check for the correct variable names
- Ensured proper loading and passing of environment variables to MCP server

## Testing Results

**Before Fix**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_id": "vqLrzGnqajPGlX9Wzq89SgqVPsN2",
  "authenticated_services": [],
  "message": "Use the Paragon Connect Portal to manage your integrations."
}
```

**After Fix**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_id": "vqLrzGnqajPGlX9Wzq89SgqVPsN2",
  "authenticated_services": [
    "linkedin",
    "googleCalendar",
    "googledrive",
    "googlesheets", 
    "notion",
    "gmail"
  ],
  "message": "Use the Paragon Connect Portal to manage your integrations."
}
```

## Key Logs Indicating Success

1. **Environment Variables Loaded**:
   ```
   [ServerRegistry] Added Paragon environment variables {"serverName":"paragon","hasProjectId":true,"hasSigningKey":true}
   ```

2. **No More 401 Errors**: The Paragon API calls now return 200 OK with actual service data instead of 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Proper JWT Generation**: The JWT tokens are now properly signed with RS256 algorithm using the RSA private key.

## Impact

- ✅ Gmail authentication is now properly detected
- ✅ All other Paragon services (LinkedIn, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Notion) are detected
- ✅ Main application can now utilize authenticated Paragon services
- ✅ No more empty service arrays in authentication status checks

## Next Steps

The authentication detection is now working correctly. Users can:
1. Authenticate services through the Paragon Connect Portal in the browser
2. The main application will correctly detect and utilize these authenticated services
3. Access Gmail, Google services, Notion, LinkedIn, etc. through the MCP integration

## Technical Notes

- The fix ensures proper RSA key handling for JWT signing
- Environment variable loading is now consistent between development and production environments
- The MCP server properly receives and uses the Paragon credentials from the main application
