# üöÄ Quick Code Signing Setup - Eliminate Security Warnings

## ‚ö° Fast Track: Get Signed DMG in 30 Minutes

### Option 1: Apple Developer Program (Recommended)
**Cost**: $99/year | **Time**: 15-30 minutes | **Result**: Fully trusted, no warnings

#### Step 1: Join Apple Developer Program (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/
2. Click "Enroll" ‚Üí Sign in with Apple ID
3. Pay $99/year fee
4. Wait for approval (usually instant)

#### Step 2: Get Certificates (10 minutes)
```bash
# Method A: Automatic (Easiest)
# 1. Install/Open Xcode
# 2. Xcode > Preferences > Accounts > Add Apple ID
# 3. Select your team > Download Manual Profiles
# 4. Certificates auto-install to Keychain

# Method B: Manual
# 1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/
# 2. Create "Developer ID Application" certificate  
# 3. Create "Developer ID Installer" certificate
# 4. Download and install both
```

#### Step 3: Build Signed DMG (5 minutes)
```bash
# Your build system is already configured!
# Just build with certificates installed:
npm run build

# Verify signing worked:
codesign -vvv --deep --strict dist/mac*/Leviousa.app
spctl -a -vvv -t install dist/Leviousa-*.dmg
```

#### Step 4: Release Signed Version
```bash
# Create new signed release
gh release create v1.0.1 dist/Leviousa-1.0.1-arm64.dmg --title "Leviousa v1.0.1 - Signed Release" --notes "‚úÖ Fully signed and trusted - no security warnings!"
```

### Option 2: Third-Party Signing Service
**Cost**: $20-50/month | **Time**: 10 minutes | **Result**: Signed but not Apple-verified

- **SignPath**: Enterprise signing service
- **DigiCert**: Code signing certificates
- **GlobalSign**: Developer certificates

### Option 3: Self-Signed Certificate (Testing Only)
**Cost**: Free | **Time**: 5 minutes | **Result**: Still shows warning, but different message

```bash
# Create self-signed certificate (testing only)
security create-keypair -a rsa -s 2048 -f CSSM_ALGID_RSA_WITH_SHA1 -k login.keychain "Leviousa Developer"

# Build with self-signed cert (still shows warnings)
CSC_NAME="Leviousa Developer" npm run build
```

## üöÄ What Happens After Signing

```
"Leviousa-1.0.0-arm64.dmg" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.
[Move to Bin] [Cancel] [?]
```

**After (Signed)**:
```
[DMG opens immediately, no warnings]
[Drag Leviousa to Applications folder]
[Launch immediately, no additional warnings]
