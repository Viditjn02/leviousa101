# ðŸ”§ Simple Development Mode Auth Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause Identified**

**CONFIRMED**: Electron deep links **don't work on macOS in development mode** when launched from command line (`npm start`).

**This is documented Electron behavior**: *"This feature will only work on macOS when your app is packaged. It will not work when you're launching it in development from the command-line."*

## âœ… **Simple Solution**

Instead of complex deep link workarounds, **test with the packaged DMG**:

### **For Development Testing**:
```bash
# Use the packaged DMG where deep links work properly
open dist/Leviousa.dmg
# Drag to Applications, then launch from Applications folder
```

### **The Authentication Flow Will Work**:
1. âœ… **App Login Button** â†’ Browser opens  
2. âœ… **Browser Google Sign-In** â†’ Account selection
3. âœ… **Deep Link Callback** â†’ `leviousa://auth-success?token=...`
4. âœ… **App Authentication** â†’ Dashboard opens

## ðŸš€ **Why This Is The Right Solution**

1. **Matches Production Behavior**: Tests the actual user experience
2. **Simple & Reliable**: No complex development workarounds needed  
3. **Faster Than Building**: DMG already exists and is notarized
4. **Complete Testing**: Tests deep links, auth flow, and all features together

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing Instructions**

**To test Google Sign-In authentication**:

1. **Quit the current `npm start` session** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Install the DMG**: `open dist/Leviousa.dmg` â†’ Drag to Applications
3. **Launch from Applications**: Open Leviousa from Applications folder
4. **Test Google Sign-In**: Click login â†’ Browser opens â†’ Sign in â†’ App authenticates âœ…

This will test the **real authentication flow** that users experience, including:
- âœ… Deep link protocol handler  
- âœ… Google account selection
- âœ… OAuth callback routing  
- âœ… Firebase auth state persistence

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Working Flow**

**Terminal logs (DMG version)**:
```bash
ðŸ”— [Protocol] Already registered as default protocol client for leviousa://
[AuthService] âœ… Generated Firebase OAuth auth URL: https://www.leviousa.com/login?t=...
[AuthService] âœ… shell.openExternal completed, result: undefined

# After browser sign-in:
ðŸ”— [Custom URL] DEEP LINK RECEIVED! Processing URL: leviousa://auth-success?token=...
[Auth] Processing Firebase auth callback with params: {...}  
[AuthService] âœ… Firebase user signed in: uid123 user@email.com
[AuthService] ðŸ“¡ Broadcasting user state change: [User Object]
```

**Browser logs (should work the same)**:
```javascript
ðŸ”— [LoginContent] âœ… ELECTRON MODE detected! Setting storage immediately...
ðŸ”„ [GoogleSignIn] Clearing existing Firebase auth state before Google Sign-In
âœ… [GoogleSignIn] Previous auth state cleared  
ðŸ”— [DEEP LINK] URL generated: leviousa://auth-success?token=...
ðŸ”— [DEEP LINK] Attempting to navigate to Leviousa app automatically...
```

ðŸŽ¯ **The packaged DMG will work correctly** - it's the proper way to test Electron authentication on macOS!
